# Datapack Mashup Bot
This is a script which creates random Minecraft Datapack mashups for you to play by querying Planet Minecraft's trending tab.

## How to Use:
1. Install Python 3 or newer. The script has no dependencies outside of the Python standard library. 
2. [Download](https://github.com/Ravbug/DatapackMashupBot/releases/latest) the script and run it with `python3 DatapackMashupBot.py`2
   - Note: this will open your web browser in order to download the datapacks, due to how Planet Minecraft offers downloads.
3. Once the script has finished (it will print when it has completed), navigate to your downloads folder and move the datapack `.zip` files to the Minecraft world of your choice.
4. Open the world, and enjoy!

## Reporting issues and contributing
I created this script very quickly, so there are likely much better ways to accomplish what this script does. PRs are welcome!
